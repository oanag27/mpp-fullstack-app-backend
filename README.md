My project's backend system, developed in C#, serves as the backbone for my task management application. It efficiently handles CRUD operations for tasks, including sorting by name for enhanced usability. Moreover, it prioritizes reliability with a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure seamless functionality and robust performance. Additionally, to streamline development and testing processes, we leverage Faker.NET to generate realistic fake tasks, enriching our test suites and facilitating rapid prototyping.
